	<h1>Books</h1>

	<p>I love to read but I haven't been able to find much time to since coming to college, but I'm trying to change that.<br> This year I'm doing a challenge where I try to read 25 books.</p>

	<h1>Some of my favorite books from last year:</h1>
	<div class = "book-grid"> 
		<img class = "book-cover" src = "images/Creativity_inc.jpg" alt = "Creativity Inc Book Cover">
		<!-- Creativity Inc. by Ed Catmull
		One of my favorite books on positive leadership and the importance of trust and candor in an organization trying to achieve incredible things -->
		<img class = "book-cover" src = "images/Shoe_Dog.jpg" alt = "Shoe Dog Book Cover">
		<!-- Shoe Dog by Phil Knight
		A fun and inspiring story of taking a wild idea to a massive business -->
		<img class = "book-cover" src = "images/Outliers.png" alt = "Outliers Book Cover">
		<!-- Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell
		Another great book by Gladwell on the unseen traits that make exceptional people exceptional -->
	</div>

	<h1>The books I read so far this year:</h1>
		<div class="book-grid">
			<img class="book-cover" src="images/Why_We_Sleep_book_cover.png" alt="Why We Sleep Cover">
			<img class = "book-cover" src="images/thirddoor.jpg" alt="book-cover">
		</div>
		<!-- Why we Sleep by Matthew Walker
			An intersting read that makes me reevaluate the importance of sleep through a scientfic lens -->
		<!-- The Third Door
			Super fun reads -- reads more like a novel than a self-help/business book. An inspiring story of an all too familiar experience of staring at your bed room ceiling wanting to do something. . . but actually doing it -->
