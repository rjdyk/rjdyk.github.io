	<h1>Movies</h1>

	<p>Watching movies is one of my favorite activities and I made this as a way to log the movies that I watch this year. I also try to keep up to date on my letterboxd.</p>

	<p>This year I'm also taking a Philosophy of Film course that I'm really excited for!</p>


	<h1>Here are some of my favorite movies:</h1>
		<div class = "movie-grid">

			<img src = "images/Princess_Mononoke_Japanese_poster.png" alt= "Mononoke">
			<img src = "images/Moneyball_Poster.jpg" alt= "Moneyball">

	<h1>The movies I seen so far this year:</h1>
			<div class = "movie-grid">
				<img src = "images/Spider-Man_Into_the_Spider-Verse_poster.jpg" alt = "Spiderman Movie Poster">
					<!-- Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse
					Best Spiderman movie of our generation. Sorry Toby McGuire -->
				
				<img src = "images/Arrival,_Movie_Poster.jpg" alt= "Arrival Movie Poster">
					<!-- I wish I had seen this sooner. Really intriguing premise, great acting, and I'm a sucker for
					nonlinear story lines  -->
				
				 <img src = "images/Searching.png" alt = "Searching Movie Poster">
					<!-- I'd definitely recommend watching this one. A great indie thriller told in a new way -->
				
				<img src = "images/Sorry_to_Bother_You.png" alt = "Sorry to Bother You Movie Poster">
					<!-- I went in knowing this movie was going to be trippy but wow. -->
				
				<img src = "images/akira.jpg" alt = "Akira movie poster">
					<!-- All of it went over my head but this movie was still an incredible experience -->
				
				<img src = "images/Interstellar_film_poster.jpg" alt = "Interstellar Movie Poster">
					<!-- It was great to rewatch it again with friends. (Also it gets better with rewatches) -->
				<img src = "images/40yovirgin.jpg" alt = "40 Year Old Virgin Movie Poster">
					<!-- Surprisingly funny -- I was shocked since I'm not a huge rom-com guy.
						Some insane quotes from "Put the pussy on a pedastal" to "Plant the seed, wait for the plant to grow, then fuck the plant." Weird ending though. . . -->
