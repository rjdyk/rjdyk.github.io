Movies

Watching movies is one of my favorite activities and I made this as a way to log the movies that I watch this year. I also try to keep up to date on my letterboxd.

This year I'm also taking a Philosophy of Film course that I'm really excited for!

Here are some of my favorite movies:
	The Prestige
	Good Will Hunting
	Moneyball
	Princes Mononoke

The movies I seen so far this year:
	Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse
		Best Spiderman movie ever. Sorry Toby
	Arrival
		I wish I had seen this sooner
	Searching
		I'd definitely recommend watching this one. A great indie thriller told in a new way
	Sorry to Bother You
		I went in knowing this movie was going to be trippy but wow.
	Akira
		All of it went over my head but this movie was still an incredible experience
	Interstellar
		It was great to rewatch it again with friends. (Also it gets better with rewatches)
