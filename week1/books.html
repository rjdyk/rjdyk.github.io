Books

I love to read but I haven't been able to find much time to since coming to college, but I'm trying to change that. This year I'm doing a challenge where I try to read 25 books.
Some of my favorite books from last year:
	Creativity Inc. by Ed Catmull
		One of my favorite books on positive leadership and the importance of trust and candor in an organization trying to achieve incredible things
	Shoe Dog by Phil Knight
		A fun and inspiring story of taking a wild idea to a massive business
	Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell
		Another great book by Gladwell on the unseen traits that make exceptional people exceptional

The books I read so far this year:
	Why we Sleep by Matthew Walker
		An intersting read that makes me reevaluate the importance of sleep through a scientfic lens

Here are the next one's I plan to read:
	Logical Chess by Irving Chernev 
	Save the Cat by Blake Snyder
	The Code Book by Simon Singh
	The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt
	Watership Down by Richard Adams
