	<p>Watching movies is one of my favorite activities and I made this as a way to log the movies that I watch this year. I also try to keep up to date on my letterboxd.</p>

	<p>This year I'm also taking a Philosophy of Film course that I'm really excited for!</p>

				<img src = "images/Spider-Man_Into_the_Spider-Verse_poster.jpg" alt = "Spiderman Movie Poster">
					<!-- Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse
					Best Spiderman movie of our generation. Sorry Toby McGuire -->

					nonlinear story lines  -->

					<!-- I'd definitely recommend watching this one. A great indie thriller told in a new way -->

					<!-- I went in knowing this movie was going to be trippy but wow. -->
				
				<img src = "images/akira.jpg" alt = "Akira movie poster">
					<!-- All of it went over my head but this movie was still an incredible experience -->
				
				<img src = "images/Interstellar_film_poster.jpg" alt = "Interstellar Movie Poster">
					<!-- It was great to rewatch it again with friends. (Also it gets better with rewatches) -->
